## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Aniket — an aspiring Data Engineer currently working at Cognizant in the data domain. My work gives me close visibility into enterprise-scale data pipelines, AWS environments, and Airflow DAGs. Outside work, I'm focused on upskilling through real-world projects and hands-on experience with modern data engineering tools.

I'm passionate about building scalable data pipelines, automating data flows, and using data to solve meaningful problems. I'm also actively practicing DSA to prepare for long-term goals including FAANG-level roles.
