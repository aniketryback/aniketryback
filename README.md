## About Me

Hi, I'm Aniket! I'm a data enthusiast with a strong analytical foundation built upon my Computer Science Engineering background and my ongoing I'm currently working in the Data Domain in Cognizant, Kolkata, India.
My journey has equipped me with a unique perspective, blending a deep understanding of life sciences with a passion for extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets. I'm eager to leverage my technical and analytical skills as an entry-level Data Specialist, contributing to data-driven decision-making.

During my academic career, I've honed my abilities in:

* Working with complex data structures
* Identifying patterns and trends
* Laboratory techniques and data management
* Statistical analysis
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data Visualization
* Hypothesis Testing
* Database querying and manipulation (SQL)
* Predictive modeling concepts (through my Data Science studies)

In my spare time, I'm dedicated to continuous learning, exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and tackling challenging problems through data. I thrive in both collaborative and independent environments, driven by the satisfaction of uncovering valuable insights.

## Portfolio Projects

This repository showcases my skills and progress in Data Analytics and Data Science through a collection of projects. Below is a brief overview of each:

### Python

* **Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie**
    * **Goal:** To determine the key factors influencing a movie's financial success.
    * **Description:** Analyzed a dataset of movies (1980-2022) focusing on correlations between budget, gross earnings, ratings, genres, and other features. Implemented data cleaning, EDA, correlation analysis (including Pearson's correlation), and data visualization.
    * **Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Correlation Matrices, Hypothesis Testing, Data Visualization.
    * **Technology:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.
    * **Results:** Identified votes and budget as having the strongest positive correlation with gross earnings, while the production company showed no significant correlation.
    * **Code:** [Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie.ipynb](link-to-your-movie-analysis-notebook)

* **Tech Store Sales Analysis**
    * **Goal:** To analyze the sales history of a tech store to identify performance insights and potential areas for improvement.
    * **Description:** Examined sales records including product details, order information (ID, date, price, quantity), and purchase address. Performed data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, EDA, sales trend analysis (by month, city), and hypothesis testing on frequently sold items.
    * **Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Data Visualization.
    * **Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.
    * **Results:** Calculated and visualized sales trends, identified top-selling items by month and city, and provided insights into the factors driving their popularity.
