## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm currently working in the data domain at **Cognizant**, with hands-on exposure to multiple production data pipelines and AWS services. While I monitor and support real-world pipelines by day, I build my own data projects by night.

I’m passionate about cloud-first data engineering, solving real-world ETL problems, and constantly leveling up my skills with projects and hands-on learning. My dream is to break into **MAANG-level companies** as a rock-solid Data Engineer.
